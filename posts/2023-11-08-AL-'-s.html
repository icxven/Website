      <p>A/L's is about how much you can brute force in life. how much you can hack around with things. how powerful your brain's processing power is. how long can your brain process stuff without overheating. how many threads it can allocate to this single task without risking to throttle other processes, how great your memory is, the more you read n write to the memory the more you will remember, managing memory locations, de-fragmenting stuff regularly, emptying your recycling bin regularly & how much power it consumes while doing it all. it all should be in balance. I'm two months away from A/L's, I'm overheating so much. I needed to cool down so I wrote what was on mind this moment. I don't think it will help, anyways good luck if you're reading this & doing A/L's.</p>
