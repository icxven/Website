      <p>If you're creating a website or app for a business or any other purpose, please keep it simple. People don't want to wait for your 2MB animation to load or the 7MB JavaScript libraries that you're loading just to make it look cool. Most of the time, people want to get something done quickly, so including unnecessary animations will only make it a hassle. The modern web is already bloated enough with all the applications written with your favorite JavaScript library. Stop making it more bloated. Although people might say otherwise, we all know that more than half of the websites process content on the server. So, stop wasting time and just serve plain HTML and CSS from servers. Use CDNs or whatever means necessary to optimize your website's load time. People don't care about your code, they just want it to load faster so they can move on with their lives. Most people tend to code everything onto their application. Instead, make a separate API for such items and avoid serving PNGs. There are many guides available on converting images into more suitable formats like AVIF and WEBP. Most modern-day browsers support them, so please look into them. Even if you convert your images, you should make sure to lazy load them. You can do this natively from HTML now. 

To clarify something, JavaScript is not a complete problem. It's the way you use it. If you're loading a 500KB JavaScript just to float some image or do something similar, there is a problem. There are more resource- and time-efficient solutions that you can explore. It's not good to load too much JavaScript if you care about people's privacy. 

In summary, people don't care about your code, they just want it to be less bloated and optimized for faster load times.</p>
